Gemini Clone is a React-based application that mimics the functionalities of the Gemini assistant. This project leverages the Gemini API to provide AI-driven responses and interactions, enhancing user experience with personalized greetings and prompt suggestions. The application features a sleek design using Tailwind CSS and utilizes local storage to remember user inputs and preferences.

## Features

- **Custom Prompt Suggestions**: A list of predefined custom inputs is provided for quick selection and inspiration.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode Support**: The interface supports dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Responses are displayed using a Markdown renderer for a clean and readable format.
- **Menu Toggle**: Users can toggle the sidebar menu to view or hide additional options.
